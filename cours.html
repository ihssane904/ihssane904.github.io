<h1>Present countinuous:</h1>

 <p id="bb"> To make this tense we use am / are / is + verb + ing<p>
<p><b id="c">so we never say: </b> I am play, but I am playing. This is why it is necessary to learn by heart how to use the verb to be in the present .</p>

<li>For most verbs we just add ing :<i id="b">speak--> speaking</i><br></li>
<li>For verbs that end with e,we omit the e and add ing : <i id="b">dance--> dancing</i><br></li>
<li>For COV(consonant-vowel-consonant) verbs, we double the last consonant : <i id="b"> put--> putting ;sit--> sitting ; run--> running.</i><br></li>
<li>when the stress is not on the last syllable, we do not doublethe consonant: <i id="b">listen--> listening</i><br></li>
</p>
<p id="1234">we use this tense:<br>
<ul>For actions happening now at the time of speaking.
<li>I am listening to you.</li>
<li>I am paying attention</li>
</ul>
<ul>For actions happening at the present time.
<li>she is preparing for the exam.</li></ul>
<p>We use time expressions like <b> now; at the moment; at the time being; this year </b> and some verbs like <b>listen; look</b>
 exemple:I'm doing my research this year.<br>
         look! the cat is pulling a snake.</p>
